The site in action!

## Install + Setup

  - clone down [this repo](https://github.com/hheyhhay/travel-tracker) 
  - run ``npm install``
  - run ``npm start``
  
  - clone down [the local storage](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/travel-tracker-api) in a outside directory
  - run ``npm install``
  - run ``npm start``

At Page Log-in use:
  username: travler50
  password: travel
  
  to change users, replace the number 50 with any integer 01 - 50.
  
 At main page, current, past, upcoming trips will be displayed. At the bottom of the page book a new trip by clicking the new trip button. Fill out the form, see the price, and decide to book or not.
 
 At the main page, one can also see the amount they've spent throughout the year by clicking the show amount button.

## Wins
  
  - Being able to book a new trip and it generate a new POST and having it render back on the page was a big success
  - Understanding more how information flows through code and changes
  - Aesthetically, this is my favorite app yet I've made
  - Understanding how POST/FETCH work 

## Challenges + Improvements
   - Timing my project out better and working through bugs at the end of each iteration and not waiting till the end to fix them
   - I would like the new trips id's to not be generated by Date.now(), but it's what works. 
   - Make the site mobile friendly and improve the SCSS varibles
   - Complete iteration 4
